lyqi - LilyPond quick edit mode for GNU Emacs

This is an Emacs mode for editing LilyPond files.  It focuses on fast
note entry, using the computer keyboard.  There are two editing modes:

- a normal mode, where the computer keyboard is used as usual,
  typically for modifiying anything that are not notes (lyrics, score
  structure, scheme, etc);

- a note insertion mode, where most alphabetic keys are bound to
  special note insertion/modification commands: insertion of notes,
  modification of alteration, octave, duration, in one key stroke,
  with instant audio feedback (only implemented on Mac OS X).

It also features (rather basic) auto-completion of LilyPond built-in
keywords and commands, shortcut from keyword to LilyPond manual,
compilation and view commands.  LilyPond language and Scheme language
are distinguished, so coloring takes care of both situations.

Installation
============
First, check that pre-requisites are installed and available in emacs
load-path. If your Emacs version is older than 23, you'll have to install
eieio manually:
- eieio <http://cedet.sourceforge.net/eieio.shtml>

After having downloaded and unpacked the archive, run:
  $ make

This will:
- download the LilyPond index page from the website and generate the
  help code (shortcuts to documentation);
- generate the keyword/functions/commands code (for completion);
- make a single lyqi.el file;
- bytecompile it, using emacs found in PATH.  To use another one type
  instead e.g.:
  $ make lyqi.elc EMACS="/Applications/Aquamacs\ Emacs.app/Contents/MacOS/Aquamacs\ Emacs"

Then run:
  $ make install-source

Finally, change your .emacs to make use of lyqi:

  ;; load lyqi
  (load "/path/to/lyqi") ;; path to lyqi.elc file, without .elc extension
  ;; automatically use lyqi mode when editing .ly and .ily files
  (add-to-list 'auto-mode-alist '("\\.ly$" . lyqi-mode))
  (add-to-list 'auto-mode-alist '("\\.ily$" . lyqi-mode))

On Mac OS X, the following utilities are also available:

- EmacsPointAndClick: enable point and click for emacs
(TODO: explain emacsclient in PATH, association between textedit URLs
and EmacsPointAndClick)

- MidiScript: audio feedback when entering notes

To build them, type:
  $ make osx


Customization
=============

In Emacs customize this variables:

- lyqi-prefered-languages
- lyqi-keyboard-mapping
- lyqi-custom-key-map
- lyqi-midi-backend

In my .emacs:

(custom-set-variables
 '(lyqi-prefered-languages '(italiano nederlands))
 '(lyqi-prefered-octave-mode 'absolute)
 '(lyqi-keyboard-mapping 'azerty)
 '(lyqi-custom-key-map '(("w" "\\trill")
                         ("x" (space-around . "\\appoggiatura"))
                         ("n" "~")
                         ("," "(")
                         (";" ")")
                         (":" "[")
                         ("=" "]")
                         ("\C-m" lyqi-insert-pipe-and-return)
                         ("$" lyqi-insert-pipe-and-return)))
 '(lyqi-projects-language '(("~/src/lilypond" nederlands)
                            ("~/Documents/LilyPond" italiano)
                            ("~/Documents/LilyPond/Haendel/Opera/GiulioCesare" nederlands)))
 '(lyqi-midi-backend 'osx)
 '(lyqi-pdf-command "open")
 '(lyqi-midi-command "open")
 ;; ...
)
